# Placement Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a student will get placed based on academic and profile features.

Steps covered:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Encoding categorical features
- Feature scaling
- Model training (Logistic Regression and Random Forest)
- Model validation and comparison
- Saving trained model and scaler

Dataset:
Student Placement Dataset from Kaggle (link here)

Next steps:
- Resume analysis using NLP
- Backend API for real-time predictions
